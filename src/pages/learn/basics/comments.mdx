# Comments

THP supports single and multi line comments:


## Single line

Begin with double slash `//` and continue until the end of the line.

<Code thpcode={`
// This is a single line comment
print("hello!")

print("the result is {5 + 5}") // This will print 10
`} />


## Multi line

These begin with `/*` and end with `*/`. Everything in between is ignored.

Multi line comments can be nested in THP.

<Code thpcode={`
/*
    This is a
    multiline comment
*/
`} />

<Code thpcode={`
/*
    Multiline comments
    can be /* nested */
*/
`} />

## Documentation comments

TBD: Should doc comments use triple slash `///`? or `/** */`?
