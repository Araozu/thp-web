# Hello, world!

## THP source code

Unlike PHP, THP code is written directly. There is no need to use any `<?php` tags,
just write the code like any other programming language.

As a consequence of this, HTML templates are defined in other ways, which will be
detailed later on.

To write a hello world program write the following code in a file:

```thp
print("Hello, world!")
```

Then run `thp hello.thp` from your terminal.


## Instruction separation

THP uses whitespace to determine when a statement is over. In short,
where PHP uses a semicolon `;`, THP uses a newline.

```php
echo("A");
echo("B");
echo("C");
```

```thp
print("A")
print("B")
print("C")
```

As a consequence of this, there can only be 1 statement per line.
