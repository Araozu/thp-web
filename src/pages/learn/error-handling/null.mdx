# Nullable types

All datatypes in THP disallow the usage of `null` by default.
To represent `null` we must use nullable types, represented
by the question mark `?` character.

For instance, a POST request may have a `username` parameter,
or it may not. This can be represented with an `?String`.

<Code thpcode={`
?String new_username = POST::get("username")
`} />

When we have a `?Type` we cannot use it directly. We must first
check if the value is null, and then use it.

The syntax `?` returns `true` if the value is not null.

<Code thpcode={`
if new_username?
{
    // Here \`new_username\` is automatically casted to String
}

// you can also manually check for null
if new_username == null
{
    // This is the same as above
}

`} />

We must check explicitly that the value is not null. Doing
`if new_username {}` alone is not allowed.

## Usage

To create a nullable type we must explicitly annotate the type.

<Code thpcode={`
val favorite_color = null      // Error, we must define the type

?String favorite_color = null  // Ok
`} /> 

Other examples:

<Code thpcode={`
fun get_first(Array[?String] values) -> ?String {}

val result = get_first([])
`} />

## Optional chaining

If you have a `?Type` and you wish to access a field of `Type` if it exists,
you can use the optional chaining operator `?.`.

<Code thpcode={`
?Person person = ...

val name = person?.name
`} />

- If `person` is null, `person?.name` will return `null`
- If `person` is not null, `person?.name` will return `name`


## Null unboxing

The `!!` operator transforms a `?Type` into `Type`.

If you are sure that a value cannot be `null`, you can force the
compiler to treat it as a regular value with the `!!` operator.
Note the two exclamation marks.

<Code thpcode={`
?String lastname = find_lastname()

// Tell the compiler trust me,
// I know this is not null
String s = lastname!!
`} />

You can use it to chain access:

<Code thpcode={`
val children_lastname = person!!.child!!.lastname
`} />

However, if at runtime you use `!!` on a null value,
the null value will be returned and your program will
blow up later. So make sure to use this operator
only when you are sure a value cannot be null.


## Elvis operator

The Elvis operator `??` is used to give a default value in case a `null` is found.

<Code thpcode={`
// This is a function that may return a Int
fun get_score() -> ?Int {...}

val test_score = get_score() ?? 0
`} />

For the above code:

- If `get_score()` is not null, `??` will return `get_score()`
- If `get_score()` *is* null, `??` will return `0`

You can use the Elvis operator to return early

<Code thpcode={`
val username = get_username() ?? return
`} />
