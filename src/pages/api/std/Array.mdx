# Array

A THP array is an abstraction on top of PHP arrays.

THP Arrays contain an ordered list of values of a unique datatype, that is to say,
you cannot store values of different datatypes inside an Array.

If you need to store values of different types, see Tuples.

THP arrays are 0-indexed.

## Signature

<Code thpcode={`
type Array[T] = Map[Int, T]
`} />

Where `T` is the datatype that the Array stores. For example:

<Code thpcode={`
Array[Int]              // An array of integers
Array[Float]            // An array of floats
Array[Array[String]]    // A 2-dimensional array of strings
`} />

## PHP array internals

<Warning>
TL;DR: **Never** assign to an array using an invalid index. If you do
the program will not crash, instead it will not behaved as expected
[(this is a common problem in PHP)](https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/).
THP tries its best to solve such behavior.
</Warning>


Since THP compiles down to PHP, it's important to understand how PHP
represents arrays internally.
PHP doesn't have arrays. Instead, PHP has ordered maps and syntax sugar
to make them look like arrays.

When declaring an array like:

<Code thpcode={`
var arr = ["a", "b", "c"]
`} />

in reality what goes into memory is a map with numbers as keys:

```php
array(
    0 => "a",
    1 => "b",
    2 => "c",
);
```

As long as this map contains valid keys, it can be treated as an array.
We can loop over it, read and write.

However, once we assign to an invalid index, it cannot be treated as an array anymore.

Invalid indexes are:

- Negative numbers
- Numbers greater than the array's length.

### Problems with iterations

PHP maps preserve insertion order. This means that when iterating over
a PHP map, values are processed in FIFO.

<Code thpcode={`
var numbers = ["a", "b", "c"]
numbers[-10] = "?"    // Assign to a negative index

// Now the array will be (using thp notation):
// .{
//     0: "a",
//     1: "b",
//     2: "c",
//   -10: "?",
// }

numbers[7] = "!"    // Out of bounds assignment

// Now the array will be:
// .{
//     0: "a",
//     1: "b",
//     2: "c",
//   -10: "?",
//     7: "!",
// }

// In this loop, values will be printed following when
// they were inserted, not by order of the index.
for #(_, value) in numbers
{
    print("{value} ")   // Will print: a b c ? !
}

numbers[-4] = "???"
// .{
//     0: "a",
//     1: "b",
//     2: "c",
//   -10: "?",
//     7: "!",
//    -4: "???",
// }

// When pushing, the value will be assigned to the highest key + 1
numbers.push("/")   // This will be at position 8

// .{
//     0: "a",
//     1: "b",
//     2: "c",
//   -10: "?",
//     7: "!",
//    -4: "???",
//     8: "/",
// }
`} />

This is one of many fundamental flaws with PHP. The only way to solve it
would be to check every insertion at runtime, and this would have a
performance penalty.


From now on, the documentation will continue to work with the Array
abstraction, as if all indexes were valid.



## Usage

### Empty array

To create an empty array use square brackets.
If you create an empty array, you need to specify the datatype.

<Code thpcode={`
Array[Int] empty = []
`} />


### Creation

To create an array use square brackets notation:

<Code thpcode={`
val numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
`} />

When the array is not empty, you don't need to specify a datatype.

When the Array is declared over many lines, the last
item should have a trailing comma:

<Code thpcode={`
val colors = [
    "red",
    "blue",
    "green",  // trailing comma
]
`} />

If it doesn't, the code formatter will automatically
insert one for you.

### Assignment to elements

Use square brackets notation to insert into an array or modify it:

To modify an array it must be mutable, that is, assigned to a `var`
instead of a `val`.

<Code thpcode={`
// This array cannot be modified, as it's declared with \`val\`
val immutable = [1, 2, 3]
// This is a compile time error
immutable[0] = 322

// This array can be modified, as it's declared with \`var\`
var mutable = [1, 2, 3]
// Ok
mutable[0] = 322
`} />

To append an element to an array, use the method `push()`:

<Code thpcode={`
mutable.push(4)
`} />

Do not insert into an invalid index. See [PHP array internals](#php-array-internals) to learn why.


### Iteration

Use a `for` loop to iterate over the elements of an array:

<Code thpcode={`
val colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]

for c in colors
{
    print("{c} ")
}
`} />

```sh
red green blue
```

A for loop automatically declares new immutable variables. It is a compile
error to attempt to modify those, as in the following snippet:

<Code thpcode={`
val colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]

for c in colors
{
    c = "orange"    // Compile error: Can't assign to an immutable variable
    print("{c} ")
}
`} />


You can also declare an index along with the value:

<Code thpcode={`
val colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]

for index, color in colors
{
    println("item {index}: {c}")
}
`} />

```sh
item 0: red
item 1: green
item 2: blue
```


### Access

To access a value of the array use square brackets notation:

<Code thpcode={`
print(colors[0])
`} />

Since the index might not exist, this will return a 
[nullable type](/learn/error-handling/null/) that you have to handle.


### Destructuring

THP arrays don't have destructuring, since the values can all be `null`.
If you know that the number of elements is fixed and valid, use Tuples instead.


### Operators

While PHP allows using certain operators with arrays, THP disallows that.
Methods that perform comparisons should be used instead.


### Assignment

// TODO: Detail that assignment of arrays is copy on write


## Methods

In the parameters, <code class="token keyword">self</code> is the array to operate on.
