# `Array.concat`

Concatenate with other arrays, and return the result as a new array.

## Signature

<Code thpcode={`
    fun concat[T](
        self,
        Array[T]... arrays,
    ) -> Array[T]
`} />

## Parameters

- `self`: The callee.
- `Array[T]... arrays`: Multiple arrays to concatenate the current one to.

## Return value

`Array[T]`: A new array that contains the elements from all arrays.


## Description

Concatenates the elements of the callee and the elements of each array in the
variable `array`. These values are returned in a new array.

If called without any aditional array it returns a new array with the elements
of `self`.

The returned array is a new one. However, if the elements of the callee and the
parameters are references, the returned array will contain references that point
to the same memory. This is important if, for example, the arrays contain other
arrays or objects.

## Examples

Example concatenating 2 arrays:

<Code thpcode={`
    val first  = [1, 2, 3]
    val second = [4, 5, 6]

    val result = first.concat(second)
    assert_eq(result, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
`} />

Example concatenating 3 arrays:

<Code thpcode={`
    val first  = ["a", "b"]
    val second = ["c", "d"]
    val third  = ["e", "f"]

    val result = first.concat(second, third)
    assert_eq(result, ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"])
`} />

Example concatenating without any other array. In this case
`first` and `result` are different arrays:

<Code thpcode={`
    val first  = [1, 2, 3]

    val result = first.concat()
    assert_eq(result, [1, 2, 3])
`} />

Example concatenating an empty array with a filled array:

<Code thpcode={`
    val first  = []
    val second = [10, 20, 30]

    val result = first.concat(second)
    assert_eq(result, [10, 20, 30])
`} />


## PHP interop

This method is directly compiled to `array_merge`. Since THP guarantees that
arrays only have numbers as keys, this will never produce invalid values due
to merging with an array with string keys.

If the arrays contain invalid keys (negative values, out of bounds) the merge
is performed based on the insertion order, not the keys order, and the resulting
array will have correct keys.

```php
$array_1 = [2 => "a", 0 => "b"];
$array_2 = [1 => "c"];

var_dump(array_merge($array_1, $array_2));
```

```out
array(3) {
  [0]=> string(1) "a"
  [1]=> string(1) "b"
  [2]=> string(1) "c"
}
```
