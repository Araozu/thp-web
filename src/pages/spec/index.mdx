# The THP Language Specification

This series of pages define the THP Programming Language.

THP's grammar is context-dependant.

The syntax is specified using a weird mix of Extended Backus Naur Form
and RegExp:

```abnf
; comments

syntax        = concatenation
concatenation = alternation grouping

alternation   = "a" | "b"
              | "c"
grouping      = ("a", "b")

optional      = "a"?
one_or_more   = "a"+
zero_or_more  = "a"*

range         = "1".."9"
literal       = "a"
```

## Compiler architecture

The compiler consists of 5 common phases:

- **Lexical Analysis**: Transforms the source code into tokens
- **Syntactic Analysis**: Parses the tokens and generates an AST
- **Semantic Analysis**: Checks the AST structure and performs type checking
- **IR**: Transforms the THP AST into a PHP AST
- **Codegen**: Generates PHP source code from the PHP AST



## Source Code representation

Source code is encoded in UTF-8, and a single UTF-8 codepoint is
a single character. As THP is implemented using the Rust programming
language, rules around Rust's UTF-8 usage are followed.


## Basic characters

Although the source code must be encoded in UTF-8, most of the actual
source code will use only the basic 128 ASCII characters. String contents may
contain any Unicode code point.

```abnf
underscore    = "_"

decimal_digit = "0".."9"
binary_digit  = "0" | "1"
octal_digit   = "0".."7"
hex_digit     = decimal_digit | "a".."f" | "A".."F"

lowercase_letter = "a".."z"
uppercase_letter = "A".."Z"
```




## Whitespace

THP is partially whitespace sensitive. It uses the following tokens: Indent, Dedent & NewLine
to determine when an expression spans multiple lines.

The lexer stores the indentation level of every line, and when scanning the next line,
compares the previous indentation to the new one. If the amount of whitespace is
greater than before, it emits a Indent token. If it's lower, emits a Dedent token, and
if it's the same it does nothing.


<Code thpcode={`
1 + 2
    + 3
    + 4
`} />

The previous code would emit the following tokens: `1` `+` `2` `NewLine` `Indent` `+` `3` `NewLine`
`+` `4` `Dedent`


Additionaly, it is a lexical error to have wrong indentation. The lexer stores all
previous indentation levels in a stack, and reports an error if a decrease in indentation
doesn't match a previous level.

<Code thpcode={`
if true {   // 0 indentation
    print() // 4 indentation
  print()   // 2 indentation. Error. There is no 2-indentation level
}
`} />

All productions of the grammar ignore whitespace/indentation, except those involved in
semicolon inference.


## Statement termination / Semicolon inference

**Only inside a block of code** whitespace is used to determine where a statement ends
and a new one begins. Everywhere else whitespace is ignored.

Statements in THP end when a new line is encountered:



<Code thpcode={`
// The statement ends         | here, on the newline
val value = (123 + 456) * 0.75
`} />

<Code thpcode={`
// Each line contains a different statement. They all end on their new lines

var a = 1 + 2   // a = 3
+ 3             // this is not part of \`a\`, this is a different statement
`} />

This is true even if the line ends with an operator:

<Code thpcode={`
// These are still different statements

var a = 1 + 2 +     // This is now a compile error, there is a hanging `+`
3                   // This is still a different statement
`} />


### Parenthesis

Exception 1: When a parenthesis is open, all following whitespace is ignored
until the closing parenthesis.

<Code thpcode={`
// open parenthesis found, all whitespace is ignored until the closing
name.contains(
"weird"
    )
`} />

However, for a parenthesis to begin to act, it needs to be open on the same line.

<Code thpcode={`
// Still 2 statements, because the parenthesis is in a new line
print
(
    "hello"
)

// Now it's one single statement
print(
    "hello"
)
`} />

### Indented binary operator

Exception 2:

- When a binary operator is followed by indentation:

<Code thpcode={`
val sum = 1 + 2 +   // The line ends with a binary operator
    3               // There is indentation
`} />

- Or when indentation is followed by a binary operator:

<Code thpcode={`
val sum = 1 + 2
    + 3             // Indentation and a binary operator
`} />

In theses cases, all whitespace will be ignored
until the indentation returns to the initial level.

<Code thpcode={`
// This method chain is a single statement because of the indentation
val person = PersonBuilder()
    .set_name("john")
    .set_lastname("doe")
    .set_age(32)
    .set_children(2)
    .build()

// Here indentation returns, and a new statement begins
print(person)
`} />
